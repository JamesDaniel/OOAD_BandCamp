		</li>
		
		<li>
		The system counts up the total for every tag that is used in songs that profile owner has rated.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		The top 20 most popular tags are displayed beside that profile owner’s name and profile image.

	<ol>
		<li>		
		The system finds less than 20 song tags associated with songs the profile owner has given a ‘Yah’ rating to.
		</li>
		<li>
		Profile name and Image is displayed with only the tags available.

	<h3>1.13 Search For Music</h3>
	<p><strong>Actors:</strong> Registered User, Music System</p>
	<p><strong>Scope:</strong> A social music sharing system</p>
	<p><strong>Level:</strong> User goal</p>
	<p><strong>Description:</strong> After a registered user logs in, they type in the name of 
	a song they wish to look for into the search bar. As the user types the system presents a few 
	results as hints below the search bar. Each hint will have an icon that will show the user what 
	the search result relates to for example songs, registered users or comments. The user may select 
	a hint or continue typing. When the user has finished typing or selects a hint and hits [Enter], 
	they will be directed to a page of results. </p>
	<p>The results page will list each song that contains the search text in its title, genre, 
	description, or in its comments. If the registered user is taken to this results page as a 
	result of clicking on one of the hints, the song related to that hint will be shown as the 
	first result.</p>
